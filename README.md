## EX. NO: 1 : IMPLEMENTATION OF CAESAR CIPHER
## NAME: SURYA R
## REG.NO: 212223110056

## AIM:

To implement the simple substitution technique named Caesar cipher using C language.

## DESCRIPTION:

To encrypt a message with a Caesar cipher, each letter in the message is changed using a simple rule: shift by three. Each letter is replaced by the letter three letters ahead in the alphabet. A becomes D, B becomes E, and so on. For the last letters, we can think of the
alphabet as a circle and "wrap around". W becomes Z, X becomes A, Y bec mes B, and Z
becomes C. To change a message back, each letter is replaced by the one three before it.
